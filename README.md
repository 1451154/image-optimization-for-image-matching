A demo for our paper: Joint Spatial and Frequency Domains Analysis (JSFDA): A novel Image Optimization method for Illumination-Robust Image Matching, 2020.
The image optimizing method is proposed to equalize illumination components and enhance image features for improving image matching under extreme and changing illumination conditions. Moreover, the algorithm could be applied in practical applications, such as SFM and MVS. Note that the values of parameters (d1, d2, l, h) in the algorithm vary with scenarios due to different properties of scenarios and external environment. It may affect the effectiveness of our algorithm. The details of parameter setting are depicted in our paper. If the dome can help your works, please cite our paper.
